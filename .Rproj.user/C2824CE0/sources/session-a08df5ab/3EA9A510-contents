Compositional Random Forests

\description{
Compositional Random Forests.
}

\usage{
alfa.comp.rf(xnew = x, y, x, a = seq(-1, 1, by = 0.1), ntrees, nfeatures, minleaf, ncores = 1)
}

\arguments{
\item{xnew}{
A matrix with the new predictor variables whose compositional response values are to be predicted.
}
\item{y}{
The response compositional data. Zero values are not allowed.
}
\item{x}{
A matrix with the predictor variables data.
}
\item{a}{
A vector of \eqn{\alpha} values.
}
\item{ntrees}{
The number of trees to construct in the random forest.
}
\item{nfeatures}{
The number of randomly selected predictor variables considered for a split in each regression tree node,
which must be less than the number of input precictors.
}
\item{minleaf}{
Minimum number of observations in the leaf node. If a node has less than or equal to minleaf observations,
there will be no splitting in that node and this node will be considered as a leaf node.
The number evidently must be less than or equal to the sample size.
}
\item{ncores}{
The number of cores to use. If greater than 1, parallel computing will take
place. It is advisable to use it if you have many observations and or many
variables, otherwise it will slow down the process. The default is 1, meaning
that code is executed serially.
}
}

\details{
The compositional are first log-transformed using the additive log-ratio transformation and then the multivariate random forest algorithm of Rahman, Otridge and Pal (2017) is applied.
}

\value{
A matrix with the estimated compositional response values.
